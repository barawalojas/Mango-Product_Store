						<h3><b>PURCHASE PROCEDURE :</b></h3>
							<ul style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
								<li>
									Select the articles you wish to purchase and add them to the shopping basket, by clicking on the corresponding icon.
								</li>
								<li>
									The shopping basket contains the reference of the selected item, its name, size, colour and price in the corresponding country (including taxes). The quoted price does not include transport costs, which will vary according to the delivery method selected.
								</li>
								<li>
									To proceed with the purchase, the user’s personal details will be required and will be included on our database in order to process the order and simplify future purchases via the Website. The personal details provided by users will be treated in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Users may, at any moment, access the personal details they have provided and information on the orders they have placed. Mango reminds users that their personal details must be as accurate as possible in order to avoid any confusion or errors in the dispatch of the item(s) purchased. Furthermore, wherever expressly requested by users, they will receive information and publications relative to the MANGO Group by post and/or SMS.
								</li>
								<li>
									Once the order has been completed, and before the order is confirmed, the user will be provided with an itemised summary of the order, identifying the item(s) purchased, the total price (including transport and taxes) and the order delivery details, in order for the user to confirm this by clicking on the 'Confirm payment' button.
								</li>
							</ul>
								<p>Purchases may be paid for using a credit or debit card (Visa, Visa Electron and MasterCard). Payment method other than the one specified in the present conditions of sale will not be accepted. For payments by credit or debit card, the charge will be made online, in other words, in real time, through the payment gateway of the corresponding financial entity, once it has been confirmed that the data sent by the user is correct. <br>
										Once the transaction has been confirmed, the order number will be displayed on the webpage, allowing users to track the order from their computer at any moment. <br>
										An automated order confirmation e-mail will also be sent to the address indicated by the user with acknowledgement of receipt, with a description of the order and the personal details provided. If you do not receive this e-mail, this could be due to a temporary communications problem in the network or an error in the e-mail address entered. In both cases, Mango advises the user to contact Customer Services. Similarly, an e-mail will be sent to the user confirming that the product has been dispatched.

								</ul>
								
					<h3><b>PRICE &amp; PAYMENT :</b></h3>
					
						<h3>Payment and currency</h3>
							<p>The prices on this Webpage are quoted in RS. <br>
							Mango allows users the option to select the destination country before placing their order, so that they can see the prices with the corresponding taxes included. If the customer subsequently modifies the delivery address and the destination country, the prices displayed in the final summary of the order may vary.</p>
					
						<h3>Taxes</h3>
							<p>In accordance with the current legislation, Mango is obliged to charge VAT on all orders with delivery addresses in member states of the European Union. <br>VAT will be charged at the legally applicable rate.<br>
							All orders where the destination is outside the EU, will not be charged communitarian VAT, as they are exempt, on the other hand, any other taxes and/or custom duties applicable within the country of choice will be applied.</p>
					
						<h3>Payment methods</h3>
							<p>Mango only accepts payment by credit or debit card (Visa, Visa Electron and MasterCard).
							Payment by credit or debit card.<br>
							Mango accepts payments for purchases made via its Website with the following credit or debit cards: Visa, Visa Electron and MasterCard.<br>
							For payments by credit or debit card, the charge will be made online, in other words, in real time, through the payment gateway of the corresponding financial entity, once it has been confirmed that the data sent by the user is correct.</p>
					
						<h3>Payment security</h3>
							<p>In order to offer maximum security in the payment system, Mango uses the secure payment systems of the leading financial entities in e-commerce. Therefore, all confidential data is transferred directly and in an encrypted format (SSL) to the corresponding financial entity. For payment by Visa and MasterCard, Mango only accepts SET transactions (Secure Electronic Transactions) using the 3D Secure international protocol, which can be identified by the Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode logos. The basic aim of the Secure Electronic Transactions initiative is to guarantee the security of Internet transactions. When you make payment through the secure payment gateway, the system will automatically check whether the credit card has been activated for Secure Electronic Transactions. Next, it will connect with the issuing bank of the card, which will request authorisation for the operation via a personal authentication code. The operation will only proceed if the issuing bank of the card confirms the authentication code. In all other cases, the transaction will be rejected. We also have the GeoTrust SSL safety certificate for online transactions.<br>
							As a complementary measure to the ‘Secure payment’ system, and in order to collaborate in the prevention of Internet fraud, Mango reserves the right to check the personal details provided by customers and to take the appropriate steps (including the cancellation of the order) in order to ensure that goods are dispatched in accordance with the data that is stated on the order.</p>
					
						<h3>Purchase limit</h3>
							<p>Mango does not permit the purchase of Mango products for subsequent resale. Consequently, it is not possible to make purchases for an amount that exceeds Rs. 32,500, or for more than 40 items. Customers who wish to make purchases in excess of said amount or quantity for purposes other than resale should contact Customer Services, where they will be informed of the various options for making the desired purchase.</p>

						<h2><b>DELIVERY :</b></h2>
							<p>Delivery of items purchased at Mango.com will be carried out via an international courier company and delivered in approximately 6 to 8 working days. Delivery is free for orders over Rs. 6,500, and charged at Rs. 790 in the case of orders below this amount. <br>
							In order to avoid any delivery problems (incorrect addresses, nobody at home, etc.), you must complete the applicable form correctly and it is advisable to leave a contact telephone number in the corresponding field.
							Orders can be tracked via the Mango.com Webpage, indicating the location of the goods at each moment until final reception. <br>
							The delivery cost is calculated according to the delivery method chosen and the items purchased. The exact transport cost will be calculated every time an item is added to the shopping basket, and will be displayed on the order summary page that appears before the customer confirms the order by pressing the ‘Confirm Payment’ button, and before the credit card or debit card details are entered. <br>
							Orders cannot be delivered to military bases or PO boxes. <br>
							The delivery charges may be altered at any time without prior notice. Said change shall become effective from the moment the modification appears in the help pages and in the contract published on this Webpage. In all cases, the delivery charges that appear at the moment the order is placed shall apply.</p>

						<h2><b>EXCHANGE &amp; RETURNS :</b></h2>
							<h3>Exchange Conditions</h3>
								<p>If customers are not satisfied with the item they have received, Mango will allow them to exchange the item for another size within a 60 day period, counting from the date of reception, provided that the item has not been used or damaged. Consequently, Mango cannot accept exchanges or returns of used or damaged items (except in the case of flaws). For reasons of hygiene, underwear and swimwear items are fitted with a safety seal to prevent them being tried on or worn. If you wish to return this type of item, the label and the safety seal must remain intact. <br>
								It is not possible to change one model for another: it is only possible to exchange it for a different size. To exchange one item for another, you must follow the refund procedure and make a new purchase.
								All returns of purchased items must be carefully packaged and include a duly completed delivery note or returns form. <br>
								If you do not have said delivery note when making the exchange or return, you can download the returns form by accessing the order page (in My orders in the My account section if you are registered, or in the Orders section if you are not) at Mango.com</p>
